# Dank Machine Kiosk Interface

This is a sleek, customer‑facing slice of the Dank PoS system tailored for a 32" self‑service kiosk.
It keeps the original color palette but strips away management features to highlight
the menu on a large touch screen.

## Main Features

- Animated idle screen that wakes on touch or key press
- Scrollable product grid with large photos
- AI consultant that suggests products available on the kiosk

Run the kiosk locally with `npm run dev`. The app boots straight into the menu for a
frictionless customer experience.
